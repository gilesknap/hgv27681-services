This template will create a new repository which describes the Kubernetes configuration for IOC and service instances. Each repository represents a group of IOCs and services that are deployed to *the same cluster* and the *same namespace*. The grouping can be arbitrary, e.g. by beamline, location, technical area, maintainer etc.

ðŸŽ¤ A name for this group of IOC and service instances.

   At DLS this should be the short beamline name or the technical area
   for accelerator repos.
   hgv27681
ðŸŽ¤ A One line description of the module
   hgv27681 IOC Instances and Services
ðŸŽ¤ Default location where these IOCs and services will run.

   At DLS this should be beamline shortname or blank for the accelerator.
   hgv27681
ðŸŽ¤ The Kubernetes cluster where the IOCs and services will run.

   At DLS this should be "k8s-{beamline shortname}", "acastus" for the
   accelerator or "pollux" for test beamlines.
   argus
ðŸŽ¤ Kubernetes namespace in which the IOCs and services will run.

   At DLS this should be "{beamline shortname}-beamline" or "accelerator".
